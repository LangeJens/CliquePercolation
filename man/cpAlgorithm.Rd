\description{
Function for clique percolation community detection algorithms for weighted
and unweighted networks.
}
\details{
\code{method = "unweighted"} conducts clique percolation for unweighted networks as
  described in Palla et al. (2005). \code{method = "weighted"} conducts clique percolation
  for weighted graphs with inclusion of cliques if their Intensity is higher than the
  specified Intensity (\code{I}), which is the method described in Farkas et al. (2007).
  \code{method = "weighted.CFinder"} conducts clique percolation as in the CFinder program.
  The Intensity (\code{I}) threshold is applied twice, namely first to the Intensity of the
  cliques (as before) and then also to their \code{k-1} overlap with other cliques
  (e.g., in the case of \code{k = 3}, it is applied to the edge that two cliques share).

  For weighted networks, the absolute value of the edge weights is taken.
  Therefore, negative edges are treated like positive edges just like in the CFinder program.
  Thus, the Intensity threshold \code{I} can only be positive.

  cpAlgorithm produces a solution for all networks, even if there are no communities 
  or communities have no overlap. The respective output is empty in such cases.
